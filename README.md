Contributing:
Each homework assignment will be in its own branch.
Each member of the team will work on their own sub branch of the current homework.
Once the homework has been done, it can be merged into master.


docker setup:
build container:
`sh docker/build.sh`
run the container:
`sh docker/run.sh`
This will drop you into the docker shell with nessiescary libraries


notes:
in docker we get some optimization messages about building from source, if we start getting hangups or lengthy processing times, this could be a remedy.
