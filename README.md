docker setup:
build container:
`sh docker/build.sh`
run the container:
`sh docker/run.sh`
This will drop you into the docker shell with nessiescary libraries

notes:
in docker we get some optimization messages about building from source, if we start getting hangups or lengthy processing times, this could be a remedy.
